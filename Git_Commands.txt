Now, we have to create the New Repository in GitHub and then connect the Git with GitHub and for this click on repository and then go to (â€¦or create a new repository on the command line) and copy the (git remote add origin) line and the (ssh link) in the upper side and add both the commands and paste it to the git with an space and then copy the next command (git push -u origin master) and paste in the git it shows error because there is no key present in it. So, we are generating and key for it.

Now, go to (setting) and then select (ssh and jpg key) and then go to (connecting to GitHub using ssh key) and then go to (Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent) and then go to (Generating a new ssh key) copy the text of 2nd step and then add your email as uploaded in git.

And the run the command on git (eval $(ssh-agent -s) to show the agent pid (this portion the not necessary for beginners).

then go to (Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent) section and then go to step 3 and click on (Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account) and then go to (Adding a new SSH key to your account) section copy the step 1 command (clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) and paste it in git and then paste the same command on the search panel and then copy the text of that search panel and then go to (ssh and gpg keys) in the setting and then click on (New SSH key) and fill the heading of that key and then paste the text in the description box and generate the key. 

Now we have run the command (git push -u origin master) on the git and it do not show error because the ssh key is generated and the git is linked with the GitHub and the files are pushed in the GitHub successfully.

Now, If we edit file in GitHub and then we have to pull the files of git then we will run the command (git pull origin master) to pull all the updated file on git.


.........................................................................

Now we have to check the updated file what we have edited in it.
use command
--> git status (it shows the uncommit files)
--> git diff Utility.txt  or  git diff   (it shows the updated item of the file)
--> git add . 

AFTER ADD A FILE THEN IT WILL NOT SHOWS THE UPDATED ITEM WHEN RUN THE COMMAND ( git diff Utility.txt ).

--> git diff --staged Utility.txt   (to check the updated item of file after run the command add . )
--> git status   (it shows the modified file)

IF WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE UPDATED CHANGE FROM THE GIT THEN WE HAVE TO RUN THE COMMAND

--> git status 
--> git reset Utility.txt   (it resets the file to the second last commit)
--> git status   (it shows the file in red color)
--> git checkout Utility.txt   (it removes the last updated item from the file)


............................................................................

* --> git add -a (stages All)
* --> add . (stages new and modified, without deleted)
* --> git add -u (stages modified and deleted, without new)


............................................................................

HOW TO CLONE THE FILES FROM GITHUB 
Open git bash on that folder

--> ls -la (it used to list the items of the file)
           (it having (.git/) which stores all the hidden files and all information or changes about the file)

--> git clone SSH_link_of_selected_file_of_github
